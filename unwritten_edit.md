#Unwritten - Daniel Beddingfield


##Chorus

No one else can feel it for you
Only you can let it in
No one else,,, no one else
Can speak the words on your lips
Soak yourself in words unspoken
Live your life with arms wide open
Today is where your book begins
The rest is still written






Feel the rain on your skin
